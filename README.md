The starting point for a twitter bot, inspired by Christopher Strachey's love letter generator

For the class "Radical Software", Eugene Lang College, Fall 2021

I created this bot as an excuse to harass Ted Cruz on Twitter, or at least annoy him in some way. The statements that I came up with aren't necessarily NOT true... I would consider this satirical (some statements more than others), but its meant to shine some light on aspects of Ted that some may or may not know.

This really started because I dislike Ted as a politician (and person) and being from Texas I of course had to share my disdain somehow. I would love to expand on it, especially to put some more focus on things he's done throughout his political career.
